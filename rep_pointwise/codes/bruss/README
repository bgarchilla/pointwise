B. Garcia-Archilla and J. Novo,
   Pointwise error bounds in POD methods without difference quotients
   J. Sci. Comput. (to appear)
   Please check for volume, journal and pages in Journal of Scientific Computing
                for proper citation if you use any of the codes or data here.

Run first
     compute_snapshots.m to obtain the snapshots in file
                 the_snapshots.mat

Then, run
     the_derivs.m to get the value of the derivatives wrt time in file
                 deriv_data.mat

After that, run
     get_pod_basis_L2.m to get the POD basis wrt L2 in pod_basis_L2.mat
     get_pod_basis_H1.m to get the POD basis wrt H1 in pod_basis_H1.mat

Finally, run
     projections_L2.m to generate the maximum of the projection errors
                      the gamma_r and Table 2
     projections_H1.m to generate the prjection error of first order
                      differences values rho_m and mu_m in Table 3
                      together with Figure 2.
