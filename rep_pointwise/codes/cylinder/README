Codes to reproduce the examples in TEST 2 in Section 3.2 of 

B. Garcia-Archilla and J. Novo,
   Pointwise error bounds in POD methods without difference quotients
   J. Sci. Comput. (to appear)
   Please check for volume, journal and pages in Journal of Scientific Computing
                for proper citation if you use any of the codes or data here.

Run first
     the_diferences.m to get the value of the derivatives wrt time in file
                            deriv_data_L2.mat
                      You will also get the data for Table 4

Then, run
     get_pod_basis_L2.m to get the POD basis wrt L2 in pod_basis_L2.mat
     get_pod_basis_H1.m to get the POD basis wrt H1 in pod_basis_H1.mat

Then, run
     projections_L2.m to to generate the maximum of the projection errors
                      the gamma_r and Table 5
     projections_H1.m to generate the prjection error of first order
                      differences values rho_m in Table 6
You may also run
     projections_L2_cycle.m and projections_H1_cycle.m to get the maximum,
                      minimum and average overestimation factors.
