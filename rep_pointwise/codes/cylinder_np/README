Run first
     the_diferences.m to get the value of the derivatives wrt time in file
                 deriv_data_L2

Then, run
     get_pod_basis_L2.m to get the POD basis wrt L2 in pod_basis_L2.mat
     get_pod_basis_H1.m to get the POD basis wrt H1 in pod_basis_H1.mat

Then, run
     make_figs_cylnp to generate  the figures in Section 3.2
